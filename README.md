## Extending TfsNotificationRelay

TfsNotificationRelay can easily be extended to send notifications to other services. Notifier modules referenced in the configuration file will be loaded dynamically at run time, so TfsNotificationRelay doesn't have to be recompiled.

1. Start a new class library project.
2. Add a reference to DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.dll.
3. Create a class that implements the single method in `INotifier`. Take a look at the `SlackNotifier` class for pointers.
4. Build and drop in your new dll in the Plugins directory on the server.
5. Add a new bot element in `DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.dll.config` with the correct assembly-qualified type name and settings.
